### **Description:**
Our interactive map series will investigate State disparities in prescribed fire outcomes (acreage burned, etc) as relates to State law, permitting, and certification programs. Prior static maps exist for data circa 2018, however, these maps are difficult to access within a PDF report and do not allow a reader to make comprehensive insights about patterns of prescribed fire implementation related to multiple State-specific legislature and administrative factors.
